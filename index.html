    <h1> Ryan Le </h1>
    <p> Hi my name is Ryan! I am a third-year undergraduate at Stanford University studying computer science 
        (graduating in 2026 with both a B.S (Systems track) and M.S. (AI track) as part of Stanford's coterminal program). 
        I am broadly interested in distributed systems, low-latency programming, machine learning, and software engineering. 
        Currently, I am working on FlexFlow with the Stanford Compiler Group under Alex Aiken. </p>
    <h2> What I have worked on </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Developing a runtime system for executing distributed training in PyTorch as part of Stanford Compilers Group (FlexFlow) </li>
        <li> Engineered an automation system to streamline configuration updates for Amazon's central route estimation machine learning model</li>
        <li> Served as a teaching assistant for Stanford's data structures and algorithms course </li>
        <li> Created, debugged, and documented SQL queries for Flowers Foods & Subsidiaries delivery, customer, and item backend</li>
        <li> iOS app for tinnitus sufferers (6k downloads) called MyTinnitus </li>
